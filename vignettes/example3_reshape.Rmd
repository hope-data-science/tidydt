  When I design `longer_dt` and `wider_dt`, I could find the `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider` in `tidyr` and `melt` and `dcast` in `data.table`. Still, designing this API is not easy, as my goal is to let users use it with least pain. Here we would try to reproduce the results in the vignette of `tidyr`(<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/pivot.html>). First load the packages:
```{r setup}
library(tidydt)
library(tidyr)
```

## Longer
  First inspect the data:
```{r}
relig_income
```
  In `tidyr`, to get the longer format you need:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
relig_income %>% 
  pivot_longer(-religion, names_to = "income", values_to = "count")
```
  In `tidydt`, we have:
```{r,warning=FALSE}
relig_income %>% 
  longer_dt(group_to_keep = "religion",gathered_name = "income",gathered_value = "count")
```
  Another example from `tidyr`:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
billboard

# tidyr way:
# billboard %>% 
#   pivot_longer(
#     cols = starts_with("wk"), 
#     names_to = "week", 
#     values_to = "rank",
#     values_drop_na = TRUE
#   )

# tidydt way:
billboard %>% 
  longer_dt("wk",negate = TRUE,  
            gathered_name = "week",
            gathered_value = "rank",
            na.rm = TRUE
            )
# regex should select group_to_keep, negate could reverse that
```
    A warning would could come out because the merging column has different data types and do the coercion automatically.
    
## Wider

```{r}
## data
fish_encounters

## tidyr way:
fish_encounters %>% pivot_wider(names_from = station, values_from = seen)

## tidydt way:
fish_encounters %>% 
  wider_dt(name_to_spread = "station",value_to_spread = "seen")
```
    
  If you want to fill with 0s, use:
```{r}
fish_encounters %>% 
  wider_dt(name_to_spread = "station",value_to_spread = "seen",fill = 0)
```
  `tidydt` currently does not support spreading multiple columns. I believe this way could keep this function simple and easy to understand. When you need this function, try spread them one by one (using a loop), or try `data.table` and `tidyr`.
